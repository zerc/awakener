# Awakener
## Intro
**THIS PROJECT IS NOT A PRODUCT** but rather an improvisation for the sake of learning and fun. Do not expect it to 
work for you or to be somewhat close to production quality.

### What
A simple HTTP server which allows to wake up a server that has Wake On Lan feature enabled.

### Why
In 2022, 2nd & 3rd of June were public holidays in the UK. 
It supposed to be only one holiday but this year, in addition to the Spring Bank Holiday, 
the country celebrated Queen's Platinum Jubilee. 
That left only three working days on that week, and on 1st of June I felt like I have unused energy to spend doing a 
silly project to have some fun.

### Tools

To make things interesting, I shall not use any of the tools I use day to day. I always liked C/C++ although, I 
don't have production experience using those, I have purchased a few books to learn them and the time has come to 
try something. I've tried modern C++ a few times already so decided to go with plain **C** this time.

I didn't want to mess around with tooling and environment setup, so I've chosen **Clion** IDE with an intention to see 
how it's doing (I've used it a few years ago) and with a hope it will sort most of the stuff out for me.

### Resources

* https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/html/ - great source of information

* A bit of StackOverflow - not going to lie here, but I've tried to use it only as the last resort.
